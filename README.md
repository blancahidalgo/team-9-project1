# Overview 

The RestoFinder app uses the TripAdvisor API and IP GEO Location API to provide users with a convenient and easy-to-use tool for finding up to five nearby restaurants.  

# Usage

When you run the app, you will choose your city from a drop-down list, then the app will use the TripAdvisor API to find restaurants.
